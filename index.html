            <h2>My Journey</h2>
            <p>From dreams of flight to navigating the realms of technology, my journey is nothing short of a movie script. Born with the aspiration to soar the skies as a pilot, I moved to Canada, immersing myself in aviation studies. But life, as it often does, had other plans. Struggling to fund my education, I worked tirelessly as an order selector in a warehouse, balancing tuition, rent, and a humble life with a $650 car.</p>
            <p>As financial hurdles mounted, my dream seemed increasingly distant, leading to a period of profound despair. Amidst this, I turned to forex trading, hoping for a windfall that would reignite my aspirations. However, reality proved harsh, and the markets unforgiving.</p>
            <p>Change beckoned when I reflected on my academic strengths during high school, particularly in ICT. This introspection sparked a pivot towards technology. Starting with a role in help desk support, I delved into Google's IT support certification but soon realized my true passion lay elsewhere. Transitioning through web development, I finally found my calling in DevOps, marking the beginning of an exciting new chapter in my life.</p>
            <p>Today, I stand proud, a testament to resilience and adaptability, continuously evolving in the ever-changing tech landscape.</p>
